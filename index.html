                            System of a Down (Also known as System, or simply SOAD) is an Armenian-American heavy metal band formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. Consists of Serj Tankian, Daron Malakian, Shavo Odadjian, and John Dolmayan.

                            <p>
                                - Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio. They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan on bass and Domingo "Dingo" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as a bassist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.

                            <p>
                                - After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled "Victims of a Down". The word "victims" was changed to "system" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, Slayer. In 1995 the band made their first demo tape, Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996, and in 1997 was released Demo Tape 3. Also in 1997 John Dolmayan joined the band.

                            <p>
                                - In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, called System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles "Sugar" and "Spiders" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively.

                            <p>
                                - The group's big break arrived when their second album, Toxicity, debuted at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts. The album has eventually achieved 3x multi-platinum certification in the United States. In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the Toxicity sessions made their way onto the internet. This collection of tracks was dubbed Toxicity II by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, Steal This Album!, which was released in November 2002.

                                - Between 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to Steal This Album!, a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. In 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with Guitar magazine.

                                - On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011. They kept touring until present, some of the members made their own way in personal projects.
